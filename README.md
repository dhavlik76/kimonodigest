============
## Win Bitcoin

From now until the end of day, November 30th, win a Bitcoin from [Kimono Labs](www.kimonolabs.com) for making the most meaningful contribution(s) to the repo--all while feeling good, by helping create the world's most compatible open source reader.

## Introduction

This is an open source reader originally developed by Shri Ganeshram at [Kimono Labs](www.kimonolabs.com) and supported by Kimono Labs. The reader takes as input specially structured Kimono Labs APIs. 

This project is open to the community and will happily accept Pull Requests for additional features. If you're adding to the Parse Database, please let me know the schema, so that I can add it.

Please direct any questions to [shri@kimonolabs.com](mailto:shri@kimonolabs.com).

## Why?

Readers today require the legacy technology of RSS to operate--we'd like to make it so that anyone can create a readable page with the reader content they want, without having to program. KimReader aims to do this by leveraging the power of Kimono's API-ification Chrome Extension, a point-and-click interface friendly for devs and non-devs alike.
